Quinuagesima is a 50 day period that begins on the Sunday before Lent.

Of course, "duo" adds 2 to the 50.

The duoquinquagesimal base number system has 52 digits, and most familiarly used in reference to the approximate number of weeks in a year as well as the number of playing cards (besides Jokers, ad cards, etc.) in a standard Poker deck.
